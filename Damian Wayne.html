            <h1 style="margin-top: 0;">Damian Wayne: Heir to the Demon & Son of the Bat</h1>

            <p>Introduced in 2006, Damian Wayne is the son of Bruce Wayne (Batman) and Talia al Ghul (Ra's al Ghul's daughter). His origin is complicated since he was genetically created in an artificial womb 
                and raised by the League of Assassins until the age of 10. Trained to fight and kill, he was then introduced to Bruce as his son and immediately did not interact well with other members of the Bat Family. 
                This is because of his tendency to kill, lack of remorse and morality. However, after a near death, he decides to resides with his mother, while also monitoring his Fater's actions.
            </p>
            
            <p> During his time with his mother, they continued monitoring the Batman and his allies. It was until the threat of his grandfather, Ra's al Ghul, return emerged. 
                Rushing to assist, he eventually was able to help and defeat Ra's forces alongside Robin (Tim Drake) and assist Nightwing in taking down Jason Todd, 
                now under the helm as Batman after the supposed death of Bruce Wayne.

            <h2 class="New_Mantle">Robin</h2>
            <p>After the events of <em>Batman: R.I.P</em> and <em>Batman: Battle for the Cowl</em>, Dick Grayson (now Batman), takes Damian Wayne as his aide and dubs him the new Robin. 
                This causes Tim to search Bruce and dub the mantle "Red Robin". However, Damian is similar to Jason in terms of arrogance and undermining authority. 
                This continues on however, even with the revelation that Bruce Wayne is alive and Bruce's eventual return as the Batman. 
            </p>

            <p>After Bruce's return, he and Damian began to patrol Gotham together as Batman and Robin, though they do have issues revovling around Damian's lack of morality. 
                During their time, they relationship as father and son grew exponentially, a sight Damian's mother do not foresee. This ultimately led to Damian's death 
                as he was killed by the Heretic, Damian Wayne's adult clone, created by his Mother.
            </p>
            <p>Damian is later revived after his deceased body was rescued from Darkseid by the Bat-family. This is in part because Batman wanted his son to live again since his death proved 
                to wear a lot on Batman. However, he abandons the Batman and the Robin Identity after the death of Alfred by the hands of Bane and his falling out with the Teen Titans.
