            <h1 style="margin-top: 0;">Dick Grayson, The Original Boy Wonder</h1>

            <p>Introduced as the first Robin in April 1940, Dick Grayson was an acrobat and part of the famous "The Flying Graysons".
            After an incident in which his parents were murdered, in large part due to mob activity, he was adopted by Bruce Wayne, The Batman.
            Dick saw Bruce as a father figure and Bruce saw Dick as his son. This connection established rather quickly since both witnessed the murders of their respective parents
            and sought out vengence for it. However, since Bruce underwent the same emotional changes that Dick was experience, Dick was mentored to not only control his anger,
            but to also direct his emotions into crime fighting, similar to Bruce. What makes Dick unique however, is that Dick is a stark contrast to Bruce. He is seen as a light
            to Bruce's more darker nature and style of fighting. 
            </p>
            
            <p>During Dick's time as Robin, he eventual become part and led a team of teenage heroes known as the Teen Titans. Alongside heroes including Cyborg, Starfire, BeastBoy,
                Speedy, Raven, Kid Flash and Aqualad. Under the Justice League, he and the team would fight alongside them in various missions.
            </p>

            <h2 class="New_Mantle">Nightwing</h2>
            <p>Being Robin for many years, Dick grew tired of being thought of as Batman's aide and sought to be his own person, renaming himself as <em>"Nightwing"</em>
            This new identity he dubbed himself, happened whilst being the leader of the Teen Titans and continues to use in the main continuity today. 
            Still within the municipal of Gotham City, he protects and fights crime in the city of Bl√ºdhaven. From time to time, does he appear in crossover story arcs,
            assisting Batman and later Robin Incarnations.
