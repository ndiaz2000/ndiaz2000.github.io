            <h1 style="margin-top: 0;">Tim Drake, The Boy Genius</h1>

            <p>Introduced in March 1989; Tim Drake witnessed the murder of Dick's parents. A couple years passed, Tim saw footage of Batman and Robin (who was Dick Grayson at the time). 
                By reading their manuevers and body language, he was able to deduce their identity and followed the duo, including the time when Jason Todd was Robin.
            </p>

            <p>After the death of Jason Todd, Tim noticed behavioral and psychological changes in the Batman and convinced Dick (now Nightwing) that the Batman needed a Robin to help him. Dick relented and refused. 
                When Tim discovered that both Nightwing and the Batman were captured, he took upon the mantle of Robin and assisted in their fight against Two-Face. From their, Batman accepted him as the new Robin 
                and trained him soon after prior to going out into the streets with him.
            </p>

            <p>What makes Tim similar to Dick is that when one of his parents were killed, with the other being put into a comatose state, he still desired to do what was right 
                in the name of Justice and not pitty revenge, unlike Jason. What sets him apart however, is his intellect. Tim is very knowledge is most fields of forensics, science, and technology, 
                as well as in forms of fighting similar to the Batman. At times, his level of intellect is considered to be greater than that of the Batman. He too, also led the Teen Titans.

            <h2 class="New_Mantle">Red Robin</h2>
            <p>After the apparent of the Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson assumes the mantle of The Batman and thought of Tim as an ally, not a protege. With the mantle of Robin being passed to Damian Wayne 
                (Bruce's son), Tim left Gotham and donned the identity of Red Robin. During his time as Red Robin, he searched for Bruce, as he believed Bruce was still alive. After proving Bruce's existence 
                and the events the <em>Blackest Night and Brightest Day</em>, Tim reassumes the role of Robin during the absences of Damian Wayne.
