            <h1 style="margin-top: 0;">Jason Todd, The Black Sheep</h1>

            <p>Introduced in March 1983; originally, Jason Todd shared a similar backstory to that of Dick Grayson prior to the major DC Comics event: <em>Crisis on Inifinite Earths</em>.
                After the event, his backstory changed due to the actions of another significant in the later story arc <em>Infinite Crisis</em>.</p>

            <p>Jason Todd was street orphaned who was caught trying to steal the wheels of the batmobile by the Batman. His parents died when he was younger; his mother due to an overdose
                and his father disappeared after a botched mission for the villan Two-Face. After the encounter, stopping a gang at his school, and six months of training, Jason Todd become the new Robin
                soon after. What sets him apart from Dick is that he is not as athletic however, his ability to fight is noteworthy, especially when he channels and controls his rage. 
                But this would soon lead to many fallouts with the Batman, as well as serving a proper establishment to his identity later on.
            </p>

            <p>Due to his many fallouts and personal disdain with the Batman, fans wanted him dead. In the story arc <em>Batman: Death in the Family</em>, Jason was tricked by the Joker, 
                being decieved into thinking his mother was still alive. The Joker brutally beaten and killed Jason Todd in a factory explosion. The Batman, unable to rescue him in time, 
                found Jason's body lifeless.

            <h2 class="New_Mantle">Red Hood</h2>
            <p>In the story arc <em>Batman: Under the Red Hood</em>, Batman notices a vigilante wearing a red hood taking out criminal leaders and gangs using lethal methods. To his surprise, 
                he finds that the individual is trained and knows the Batman's tactics. It was later discovered that the red hooded figure is actually Jason Todd, who was resurrected. 
                After the revelation, Jason Todd becomes known as Red Hood, and is part of the BatFamily, being the only one who kills criminals. 
                He leads the lethal vigilante group, <strong>The New Age Outlaws</strong>, and assists the BatFamily from time to time.
